title: The Brown Dwarf to Exoplanet Connection
---

## Welcome

On April 28th and 29th, 2026 we will hold the fourth installment of The Brown Dwarf to Exoplanet Connection conference.  It will be held on the campus of the University of Delaware. We invite scientists who focus on atmospheres, fundamental parameters, formation mechanisms and beyond of both brown dwarfs and exoplanets to gather for a two day conference.  Our aim is to build upon the first three meetings which engaged attendees in a lively discussion of the current, future, and overlap status of the fields.


Registration for the meeting is free but required. Please see the link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScNDT1KaELll65sjOROxl2XfysBZvQFPWwCVUsfhWrhrynsvw/viewform).
