title: The Brown Dwarf to Exoplanet Connection
---

## Welcome

This is the fourth installment of The Brown Dwarf to Exoplanet Connection conference.  It will be held on the campus of the University of Delaware. We invite scientists who focus on atmospheres, fundamental parameters, formation mechanisms and beyond of both brown dwarfs and exoplanets to gather for a two day conference.  Our aim is to build upon the first three meetings which engaged attendees in a lively discussion of the current, future, and overlap status of the fields.

### Topics
- Brown dwarf atmospheres
- Directly imaged exoplanets
- JWST spectroscopy
- Cloud physics and chemistry
- Benchmark systems

More details coming soon.
